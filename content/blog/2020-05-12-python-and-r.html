<p>Python and R are able to communicate with each other even though they are two different coding languages. You can use reticulate in order to have R and python chunks communicate.</p>

<p>First, you must call reticulate using library(). Then you can create an object (I called mine “randomstring”) with some character value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
randomstring &lt;- &quot;This is a picture of&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Using a python code chunk, you can actually use the same variable name and things won’t get mixed up! So, I created a string to finish the rest of my sentence.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>randomstring = &quot;my dog, Millie&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can print out the output by telling python that you need to use the variable from r and then the variable in python and combine them together to get:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(r.randomstring, randomstring)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## This is a picture of my dog, Millie</code></pre>
