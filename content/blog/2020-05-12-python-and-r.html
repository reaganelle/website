<p>Python and R are able to communicate with each other even though they’re different languages! You can use the <strong><em>reticulate</em></strong> package in order to have R and python chunks communicate. Let’s look at a simple example!</p>

<p>This is a picture of my dog when she was a puppy. Let’s say I wanted to use both R and Python to say just how cute she was as a puppy.</p>

<p>First, you must call install the reticulate package using <em>install.packages()</em> and call reticulate using <em>library()</em>. Then you can create an object (I called mine “randomstring”) with some character value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
randomstring &lt;- &quot;That puppy is so&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Using a python code chunk, you can actually use the same variable name and things won’t get mixed up! So, I created a string to finish the rest of my sentence.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>randomstring = &quot;stinkin&#39; cute!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can print out the output by telling Python that you need to use the variable from R and then the variable in Python. Combine them together to get:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(r.randomstring, randomstring)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## That puppy is so stinkin&#39; cute!</code></pre>

<p>And isn’t that the truth!</p>
