> Python and R are able to communicate with each other even though they're different languages! You can use the **_reticulate_** package in order to have R and python chunks communicate. Let's look at a simple example!

This is a picture of my dog when she was a puppy. Let's say I wanted to use both R and Python to say just how cute she was as a puppy.

First, you must call install the reticulate package using *install.packages()* and call reticulate using *library()*. Then you can create an object (I called mine "randomstring") with some character value.
```{r}
library(reticulate)
randomstring <- "That puppy is so"



```

Using a python code chunk, you can actually use the same variable name and things won't get mixed up! So, I created a string to finish the rest of my sentence.
```{python}
randomstring = "stinkin' cute!"

```
Finally, you can print out the output by telling Python that you need to use the variable from R and then the variable in Python. Combine them together to get:
```{python}
print(r.randomstring, randomstring)

```
> And isn't that the truth!
