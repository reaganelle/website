Python and R are able to communicate with each other even though they are two different coding languages. You can use reticulate in order to have R and python chunks communicate. 

```{r}

```

First, you must call reticulate using library(). Then you can create an object (I called mine "randomstring") with some character value.
```{r}
library(reticulate)
randomstring <- "This is a picture of"



```

Using a python code chunk, you can actually use the same variable name and things won't get mixed up! So, I created a string to finish the rest of my sentence.
```{python}
randomstring = "my dog, Millie"

```
Finally, you can print out the output by telling python that you need to use the variable from r and then the variable in python and combine them together to get:
```{python}
print(r.randomstring, randomstring)
```
