Python and R are able to communicate with each other even though they are two different coding languages. You can use reticulate in order to have R and python chunks communicate. 

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("/profile.png")
```

```{r}
library(reticulate)
hi <- "hello"

```


```{python}
hi = "world"
print(r.hi, hi)

```
